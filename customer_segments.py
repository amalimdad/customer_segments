# Welcome to the third project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!
# 
# In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

# >**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

# ## Getting Started
# 
# In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
# 
# The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.
# 
# Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.

# In[84]:


# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print("Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape))
except:
    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")


# ## Data Exploration
# In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.
# 
# Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.

# In[85]:


# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe()) 


# ### Implementation: Selecting Samples
# To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.

# In[86]:


# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [28,22,33]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print("Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:")
display(samples)


# ### Question 1
# Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  
# 
# * What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?
# 
# **Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:
# 
# * Fresh: 12000.2977
# * Milk: 5796.2
# * Grocery: 3071.9
# * Detergents_paper: 2881.4
# * Delicatessen: 1524.8
# 
# Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be? 
# 

# **Answer:**
# - 	costomer 28: 
# [ Fresh= 4113,	Milk= 20484, Grocery= 25957, 	Frozen= 1158, 	Detergents_Paper= 8604,	Delicatessen= 5206 ]
# since customer 28 consumes more in Milk and Grocery i think he estaplish a cafe maybe breakfast resturant.  
# - costomer 22:
# [ Fresh= 31276,	Milk= 1917, Grocery= 4469, 	Frozen= 9408, 	Detergents_Paper= 2381,	Delicatessen= 4334 ]
# since customer 22 consumes the average/mean of all categorise , so he maybe establish a supermarket that contains everythings especially frish food.
# - costomer 33:
# [ Fresh= 29729,	Milk= 4786, Grocery=7326, 	Frozen= 6130, 	Detergents_Paper=361,	Delicatessen= 1083 ]
# since customer 33 consumes in all categorise except Detergents_Paper has a low value in contrast, Fresh has a hiegher value , I think he estaplish a resturant.

# ### Implementation: Feature Relevance
# One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
#  - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
#    - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
#  - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
#  - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.

# In[87]:


from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
import pandas as pd
# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
new_data = data.drop(['Detergents_Paper'], axis=1)

# TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
# Set a random state.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, data['Detergents_Paper'], test_size=0.25, random_state=40)

# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=40).fit(X_train, y_train)

# TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
r2score = r2_score(regressor.predict(X_test), y_test)
print ('the score of Detergents_Paper is ', score)
print ('while R2_score of Detergents_Paper is ', r2score)

#score of onother feature (Milk)
new_data = data.drop(['Milk'], axis=1)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, data['Milk'], test_size=0.25, random_state=40)
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=40).fit(X_train, y_train)
score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
r2score = r2_score(regressor.predict(X_test), y_test)
print ('the score of Milk is ', score)
print ('while R2_score of Milk is ', r2score)

#score of onother feature (Milk)
new_data = data.drop(['Grocery'], axis=1)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, data['Grocery'], test_size=0.25, random_state=40)
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=40).fit(X_train, y_train)
score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
r2score = r2_score(regressor.predict(X_test), y_test)
print ('the score of Grocery is ', score)
print ('while R2_score of Grocery is ', r2score)


# ### Question 2
# 
# * Which feature did you attempt to predict? 
# * What was the reported prediction score? 
# * Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?
# 
# **Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a low score for a particular feature, that lends us to beleive that that feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

# **Answer:**
# - I attempt to predict three features which are Detergents_Paper, Milk and Grocery 
# - the reported prediction score (r2_score) for Detergents_Paper and Grocery  is hiegher 0.757310991163 and  0.744017075319 respectively, it closer to 1 (perfect fit), and that's mean these two features is not necessary for identifying customers'spending habits becuase they easily build the model and predicted. while the reported prediction score (r2_score) for Milk is low 0.140773020657 that's mean this feature point is hard to predict using the other features, and it necessary for identifying customers' spending habits, and also it means the Milk feature is independent feature

# ### Visualize Feature Distributions
# To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.

# In[88]:


# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');


# In[89]:


import seaborn as sns
#create the dataframe
data_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
sns.boxplot(x=data_df['Grocery'])


# ### Question 3
# * Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
# * Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? 
# * Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? 
# * How is the data for those features distributed?
# 
# **Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? You can use [corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a [heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) (the data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values, for eg: `data.corr()`) to gain further insight.

# **Answer:**
# - from the scatter matrix, i notice that most of the data points appears near 0 among others that means the data not normaly distributed and found outliers i confirm the observation by plotting using boxplot above.  
# - there are pair of features that have correlation between them which is Grocery and Detergents_Paper has value 0.924641 >> it's a high correlation between each other. In second place come Milk and Grocery that has 0.728335 corr value, also corr 0.661816	between Detergents_Paper and Milk which is consider a good correlation. but the correlation between other features is low and some have negative correlation like Fresh and Detergents_Paper.
# - so yes, this confirm the suspicions about the relevance of the feature attempted to predict.
# - in general fron the above distribution graph, we found that the data not normally distributed and the data data points lie in Grocery and Detergents_Paper features.

# ## Data Preprocessing
# In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

# ### Implementation: Feature Scaling
# If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
#  - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.

# In[95]:



# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');


# ### Observation
# After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).
# 
# Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.

# In[96]:


# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)


# ### Implementation: Outlier Detection
# Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
#  - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
#  - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
#  - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.
# 
# **NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
# Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.

# In[97]:


from itertools import *
all_outliers  = []

# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 25)
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 75)
    
    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step = 1.5*(Q3-Q1)
    
    print("Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature))
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
   # append list of outliers in each feature in all_outliers
    all_outliers.append(list(log_data.loc[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step)), :].index))
  


#now fint the outliers that appears more than 1 in featurs " the Recurring Value"

outliers = [x for x in all_outliers if x[1] >= 2]
#find the number of outliers in each feature 
length= []
for x in all_outliers[:]:
           length.append(len(x)) 
        
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove 
outliers = []
#find the repeated outliers
import collections
outliers = [item for item, count in collections.Counter(list(chain.from_iterable(all_outliers))).items() if count >=2]
       

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)
print('number of outliers in each feature:\n', length)
print('total outliers is {} which are: {}' .format(len(chain_all_outliers), chain_all_outliers) )
print('real outliers are:', outliers)


# ### Question 4
# * Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? 
# * Should these data points be removed from the dataset? 
# * If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.
# 
# ** Hint: ** If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

# **Answer:**
# after seeing the Data points considered outliers in each feater, and finding the duplicated outliers in all features, we found this list [65, 66, 128, 154, 75] of data poits that considerd as outliers. But removing all data points that have outliers from the dataset will cuase negative effect if the dataset is small for exmple. but i gusses the outlire here should be removed becuase if i apply the k-means it will be affected by outliers, thus affected the analysis becuase the k-means selects k centroid poits and assign the nearset point to centroid.

# ## Feature Transformation
# In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

# ### Implementation: PCA
# 
# Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension â€” how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[98]:


from  sklearn.decomposition import PCA
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
pca = PCA().fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)


# In[99]:


import numpy as np
# pca.explained_variance_ratio_
pca.explained_variance_ratio_.cumsum()


# ### Question 5
# 
# * How much variance in the data is explained* **in total** *by the first and second principal component? 
# * How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components? 
# * Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.
# 
# **Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

# **Answer:**
# - variance in the data by the first and second principal component is 0.4428 + 0.2727 = 0.7155 *100 = 71.55 %  
# - variance in the data by the  first four principal component is 0.4428 + 0.2727 + 0.1198 + 0.0984 = 0.9337 *100 =93.37%  
# - i see that: dimention 1 >> has 0.44282553 explained cumulative variance. Detergents_Paper has high prinipale component. Grocery, Delicatessen and Milk have nigative weights but frozen and fresh have opposite correlation but positive-weighted. so Grocery and Milk have a good crrelation and that impacts on Detergents_Paper. 
# - dimention 2 >> has 0.71548214 explained cumulative variance. Fresh has high prinipale component and all features have negative-weighted. but Frozen and Delicatessen have a good correlation between each other and that affect the fresh feature.
# - dimention 3 >> has 0.83523496 explained cumulative variance. Fresh has high prinipale component. Grocery, Fresh and Detergents_Paper have nigative weights but frozen, Delicatessen and Milk have opposite correlation which is positive-weighted. so Delicatessen and Frozen have a good crrelation and that impacts on fresh . 
# - dimention 4 >> has 0.93366652 explained cumulative variance. the customer here spent on Frozen, it has a high positive-waighted value. in the other side, the Delicatessen has negative-weighted

# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

# In[101]:


# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))


# ### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
# When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data â€” in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[112]:


# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples =  pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
print(reduced_data)


# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.

# In[113]:


# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))


# ## Visualizing a Biplot
# A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.
# 
# Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.

# In[114]:


# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)


# ### Observation
# 
# Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories. 
# 
# From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

# In[115]:


###
'grocary', 'Milk' and 'Detergents_Paper' >> are strongly correlated with the first-component.
while 'delicatessen', 'Frozen' and  'Fresh' are correlated with the second component.
so these observations agree with the pca_results plot that obtained earlier.


# ## Clustering

# In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

# ### Question 6
# 
# * What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? 
# * What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? 
# * Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?
# 
# ** Hint: ** Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

# **Answer:**.
# -  advantages of using a K-Means clustering algorithm: good running time than GMM becuase no probapility calculation need, easy to implement and works better with linear distributions.
# -  advantages of using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm: soft clustering (sample membership of multiple cluster) or soft assigment,  cluster shape flexibility, and Works well with non-linear distributions
# - our dataset is not that huge so i think we can try both alogrithms (k-means ad GMM). 

# ### Implementation: Creating Clusters
# Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
#  - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
#  - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
#    - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.

from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

for k in list(reversed(range(2,10))):
    # TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
    clusterer = KMeans(k).fit(reduced_data) 

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
    preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Find the cluster centers
    centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

    # TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
    score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds)
    print(' when the k= {} the score is {} ' .format (k, score))
    


# In[117]:


from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
for n_component in list(reversed(range(2,10))):
    # TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
    clusterer = GaussianMixture(n_component).fit(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
    preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Find the cluster centers
    centers = clusterer.means_

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

    # TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
    score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds)
    print(' when n_component= {} the score is {} ' .format (n_component, score))
   


# In[118]:


def plt_():
    plt.figure( figsize=(16,12))
    plt.scatter(reduced_data.iloc[:,0], reduced_data.iloc[:,1], c=preds, edgecolor='black', lw=1.5, s=100, cmap=plt.get_cmap('viridis'))
    plt.show()
plt_()


# ### Question 7
# 
# * Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. 
# * Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?

# **Answer:**
# - for both algorithm Gmm and k-mean, when the number of custer is small, the silhouette-score is high. so in our dataset when number of components is 2, the silhouette score is the best. As increasing the number of clusters the silhouette score becoming low. but comparing the scores of two algorithms, the silhouette scores of GMMM is better that the scores of k-means.

# ### Cluster Visualization
# Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters.

# Display the results of the clustering from implementation

# In[120]:

# ### Implementation: Data Recovery
# Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
#  - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.
# 

# In[132]:


# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)


# In[133]:


display(data.describe()) 


# In[136]:


#viualize to compare between segments and mean of data
compare = true_centers.copy()
compare.loc[true_centers.shape[0]] = data.mean()
plt.style.use('ggplot')
compare.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(15, 5))
labels = true_centers.index.values.tolist()
labels.append('Data Mean')
plt.xticks(range(compare.shape[0]), labels)
plt.show()


# In[137]:


#viualize to compare between segments and median of data
compare = true_centers.copy()
compare.loc[true_centers.shape[0]] = data.median()
plt.style.use('ggplot')
compare.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(15, 5))
labels = true_centers.index.values.tolist()
labels.append('Data Median')
plt.xticks(range(compare.shape[0]), labels)
plt.show()


# ### Question 8
# 
# * Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?
# 
# **Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`. Think about what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

# **Answer:**
# - for segment 0: the customers consume more on 'Milk' and 'Grocery' more than the average of that data, also spend on 'Detergents_Paper' more than 75% of the data points and about 50% on Delicatessen. also approximatly 25% of the data points on Fresh so they may establish a retail that target food places maybe.
# - for segment 1: he customers spend more than 50% on fresh and Frozen. while spend low in other features, spend more than 25% on grocary and less than 25% of the data on milk. so they may establish a resturant.

# ### Question 9
# 
# * For each sample point, which customer segment from* **Question 8** *best represents it? 
# * Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*
# 
# Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.

# In[138]:


# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)
samples


# **Answer:**
# - as I see that data point 0 consume high on Grocery, Milk and Detergents_Paper so i gusses it belonges to cluster 0 , which is consistent with the above prediction. and it close to segment 0 that estaplishes a retail.  
# - while data point 1 consume high on Fresh, Frozen and consume in the second stage Grocery and Delicatessen this intuit me that it belonges to cluster 1. so i guess he estaplish a resturant 
# - finally data point 3 consume high on Fresh then Grocery and Frozen which is mean it belonges to cluster 1 again that is the same as bove prediction, and I guess he estaplishes a resturant too.

# ## Conclusion

# In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

# ### Question 10
# Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. 
# 
# * How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*
# 
# **Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

# **Answer:**
# - wholesale distributor can take the customers randomely form each cluster and put them in groups let's say two groups, group A delevier 3 days and group B delevier 5 days.  
# - redusing the delivary service from 5 days to 3 days a week, it may affect negatively for customers who consume more on food like 'Fresh and 'frozen'. since the customer who consume more on 'Detergents & Paper' and the others it may affect positifly if the customer pay for the delivery man so he will save money. but also this case not works the same for all customer bacusae maybe thy have another circumstances and the distrubioter can know that in  A/B tests by taking thier feedback.
# 

# ### Question 11
# Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
# * How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the **customer segment** data?
# 
# **Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

# **Answer:** 
# - the k-mean and gaussian Mixture can be used for good assignment the new customer to category by estimating product spending and the customer segment data.
# - the target variable could be the category labels/luster lable, so we can using supervised learner pridect the label of new customer after learning from tha training data.   

# ### Visualizing Underlying Distributions
# 
# At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.
# 
# Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.

# In[139]:


# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
vs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)


# ### Question 12
# 
# * How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? 
# * Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? 
# * Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?

# **Answer:**
# - the number of clusters shouls have shosen after studying the data and it's distribution by GMM or KMeans for exmple in our dataset it is good to have 2 or 3 clusters like here it's good of having two clusters (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers or Retailer customers) as we found  GMM working well. 
# - the customer segments that are in cluster 0, they are puerly distributed in 'Retailers', while the customers who're in cluster 2, they are puerly distributed in 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes'.
# - yes these classifications are consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments since the mean categories are these two but the sgment previously it consider the behavior of customer in pushasing products/features.
